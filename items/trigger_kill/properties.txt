"Description"
{
"" "Invisible block that kills the player when walked into."
"" "When the player dies, it looks like he fell."
"" ""
"" "* Start Open - Instead of dying, it finishes the map with a fade out. Useful if you want some sort of cinematic ending."
"" ""
"" "* Start Reversed - The invisible block will teleport to the player, so it kills him when it receives an input."
