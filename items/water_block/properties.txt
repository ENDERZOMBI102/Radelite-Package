"Description"
{
"" "A editor block's sized swimmable water."
"" ""
"" "* It insta-kills Atlas and P-Body."
"" "* Portal 2 has glitched water physics: The water pushes the player in a specific direction."
"" "* Also, env_cubes don't seem to work properly with glitched liquids."
"" ""
"" ""
"" "> To-Do - Create a new force that pushes the player in the opposite direction of the glitched water, so they both cancel each other."
