"Description"
{
"" "It's a Portal Gun with a Gravity Gun. You can switch between modes with Crouch."
"" "* It's very similar with the one in Into the Multiverse, the Portal 2 workshop map series."
"" ""
"" "> Unfortunately, there can't be more than one Portivity Gun per chamber, so both Co-Op players can't have the Portivity Gun and you can't upgrade the portals."
"" ""
"" "* **Weighted** fires both portals"
"" "* **Cube** is blue portal only"
"" "* **Ball** is orange portal only"
