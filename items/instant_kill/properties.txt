"Description"
{
"" "An invisible item that, if it receives an **input**, it will **insta-kill** the player. When the player dies, it looks like he fell."
"" ""
"" "* **Start Reversed** - Instead of dying, it finishes the map with a fade out. Useful if you want some sort of cinematic ending."
"" ""
"" "* This item is an upgrade to Radelite's Trigger Kill. Now it doesn't have a trigger, since there's already triggers in BEEMod. So, you can add different types of inputs to it. I still suggest just using an **laserfield**."
