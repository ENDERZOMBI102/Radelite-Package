**Some extras, like optional and old .vmfs and icons with layers, so you can edit them to your liking.**


 - Paint Gun.vmf - Old version of the Paint Guns. Nowadays it uses spheres, but these use blobs or nothing.

 - Fire Panel.vmf - Old version of the Fire Panel.
 
 - Fire Panel.png and .vtf - Old icons of the Fire Panel. The flame is very pretty. .png is the original file with the original size.
 
 - Icons - These are .pdn files. They're basically the icons with layers. You can open a .pdn file with Paint.NET (not a website), or perhaps a plugin or something on other image editing software.
